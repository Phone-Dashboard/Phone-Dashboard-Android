    In order to function properly, Phone Dashboard needs permission to monitor your app notifications.
</p>

<p>
    In the next screen, you will be taken to your device's settings to give Phone Dashboard permission to access this information.
    When on the <em>Device & app notifications</em> screen, please scroll to and select <em>Phone Dashboard</em>.
</p>

<center><img src="notifications-1.png" style="width: 90%; border: thin solid black;" /></center>
<p>
    On the next screen after you select Phone Dashboard, you will see a switch labeled <em>Allow notification access</em>.
    Toggle that switch on to give permission.
</p>

<center><img src="notifications-2.png" style="width: 90%; border: thin solid black;" /></center>

<p>
    Note that Phone Dashboard does not record the content of your notifications, only which apps are posting them and when those notifications are removed.
</p>

<p>
    Once this is complete, use the Android back button to return to this screen for your next steps.
